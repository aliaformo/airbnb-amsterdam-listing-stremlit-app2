# airbnb-amsterdam-listing-stremlit-app2

This repo was created to host the files for a streamlit app. 

You can see the app on this link:

All the merit and credit is for CoRise's team that has hold the Python for Data Science Course. 
I just followed their instructions the Week 2: Project â€“ Explore Airbnb Amsterdam!

Thanks
